<h2>Life</h2>
<p>From a very young age I was interested in the inner workings of the world
until fateful day, I noticed the potential of steam rising from a kettle.
My keen observational skills led me to study the mechanics of pressure and movement. 
After months of experimentation, I refined the concept, creating the first steam engine. 
This breakthrough transformed industries and changed the course of history. 
Often overlooked, my quiet persistence and intelligence proved that even the smallest 
creatures can change the world.

<i>This was wrriten by a real person with fingers</i>

<h2>Other Inventions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>LEGO Bricks</li>
    <li>Socks with holes in them</li>
    <li>Celery</li>

</ul>
